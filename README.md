# Angular 10 Starter (NGRX, Lazy Loading Modules, Feature States, Realtime Updates) 

A simple app with basic navigation. You can find list and detail views in the user module.
The architecture is feature based, which in my opinion is a better approach than the common seen layer based architecture.

### Prerequisites
- Firebase Account with user collection (as described below)
- Change the firebase config in environment.ts
